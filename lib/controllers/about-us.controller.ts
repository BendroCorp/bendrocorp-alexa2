The colonies that most people never think of - the small time mining installations, the farms and the everyday people living throughout the verse.</p><p>The mission of BendroCorp will to help facilitate the next great human expansion by assisting the average citizen with their expansion into the ever growing verse - by logistically supporting colonies, be assisting citizens in the construction of homesteads and outposts and by pushing the known boundaries of space itself. Together we will expand the frontier.</p>";
